# Bookmark Sync

I commonly use bookmarks to keep track of my reading progress through a
documentation website, but updating the bookmark is a pain since I have to
manually copy the URL, click edit, update the URL, then save. With this
extension, simply press the extension icon to automatically update your saved
bookmark for the given domain with whatever page you are currently on.

_Note: If multiple bookmarks are found that match the URL, the extension will
not update the bookmarks._
